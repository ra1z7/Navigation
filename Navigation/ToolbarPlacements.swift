                // These semantic placements come with two important benefits:
                //   - Because iOS has extra information about what your buttons do, it can add extra styling â€“ a confirmation button can be rendered in bold, for example.
                //   - Second, these positions automatically adapt on other platforms, so your button will always appear in the correct place on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and more.
